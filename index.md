# OpenClaw Agentic Workflows Research

A comprehensive research repository documenting the OpenClaw skills ecosystem, multi-agent orchestration patterns, and agentic workflow design.

## Latest Research (February 27, 2026)

### Key Findings

- **5,705** community skills on ClawHub analyzed
- **2,868** curated skills in VoltAgent's awesome list
- **36%** of scanned skills have potential security issues
- **Rapid ecosystem maturation** — many gaps from Feb 25 now addressed

### Critical Insight

The ecosystem matured rapidly between February 25-27, 2026. Skills like `cc-godmode`, `agenticflow-skill`, and `claude-team` now address previously identified gaps in multi-agent orchestration.
